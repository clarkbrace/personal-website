        My name is Clark and welcome to my website! I graduated from the
        University of Puget Sound with a degree in Computer Science. I have
        always been intrested in computers having grown up in a tech-forwared
        family. Since a young child I loved playing video games and
        tinkeringaround with computers.

        <br />I am now an aspireing software engeneer and always excited to
        learn new skils and work on fun projects. I am using this website as a
        mean to show off what I have been working on be it video games, pixel
        art, or some other form of media.
